00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,210
Good evening, dear viewers. Good evening.

2
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,310
Today is August 9th,

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,950
Saturday, the 16th day of the intercalary sixth month in the lunar calendar,

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,350
Welcome to CCTV News.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,270
First, let me outline today's program highlights.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,670
This year marks the concept that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,"

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,370
which was first proposed twenty years ago.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,930
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:45,090
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has prioritized ecological conservation as a fundamental strategy for the sustainable development of the Chinese nation,

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,170
undertaking a series of pioneering initiatives,

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,135
Significant strides have been made in building a Beautiful China.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,510
China Central Television News launches a special series,

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,010
documenting ecological transformations.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,190
Today, we begin at the birthplace of the "Two Mountains" philosophy,

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,810
in Anji, Zhejiang Province.

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,390
All localities and departments have thoroughly implemented the important directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,010
carrying out all flood prevention and disaster relief tasks,

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,270
ensuring public safety. In our special series "Sixty Glorious Years,"

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,250
"The Enchanting New Tibet" airs today,

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,030
showcasing a better life through cultural and tourism integration.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,870
For ethnic liberation and world peace,

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,490
the exhibition attracted over 300,000 visitors in July,

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,010
with the Consumer Price Index remaining flat year-on-year,

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,810
while showing a slight month-on-month increase.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,610
Multiple countries and international organizations condemned Israel's plan to take over Gaza.

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,390
Russia stated that

27
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,610
the presidents of Russia and the United States will hold talks in Alaska on August 15,

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,870
focusing on long-term peaceful solutions to the Ukraine crisis.

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,265
Here's the detailed report.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,190
In 2005,

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,050
In 2005, Comrade Xi Jinping, then Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, first proposed during an inspection tour of a fishing village in Anji, Zhejiang,

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,810
the "Two Mountains" concept that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,"

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,305
profoundly illustrating the dialectical unity between ecological conservation and economic development.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,360
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,440
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has treated ecological civilization construction as a fundamental strategy for the sustainable development of the Chinese nation,

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,800
has undertaken a series of pioneering initiatives,

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,855
giving rise to Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization,

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,890
the advancement of ecological civilization across China

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,670
has undergone transformative changes both in theory and practice,

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,230
achieving historic and pivotal

41
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,610
comprehensive transformations

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,215
Significant strides have been made in building a Beautiful China.

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,170
Starting today,

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,090
China National Television will launch a special series

45
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,750
to witness ecological transformations,

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,610
through the strides of socioeconomic progress,

47
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,165
and from the daily lives of every citizen to perceive the green momentum of China's new era.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,420
Today,

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,140
we begin at the birthplace of the "Two Mountains" philosophy,

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,945
starting from Anji, Zhejiang.

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,100
In the midsummer heat, the small town of Anji is lush with greenery,

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,245
bustling with crowds,

53
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,555
Over 22,000 sensors are scattered throughout every corner of the town.

54
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,850
The sensing equipment on the carbon flux monitoring towers in the bamboo forests,

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,590
continuously monitors every breath of the bamboo groves,

56
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,515
ultimately converting it into measurable data that quantifies the bamboo forest's carbon dioxide absorption and storage capacity.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,120
Over the past decade,

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,100
the carbon sequestration per hectare here has increased to 6.6 tons,

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
making bamboo forests highly efficient carbon sinks.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
The resulting carbon credits can be traded.

61
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,205
This generates over 28 million yuan annually in carbon storage revenue for bamboo farmers across the county,

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,300
A hyperspectral camera monitors this urban stream regularly, tracking changes in water pollutants like ammonia nitrogen.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,460
Researchers transform the monitored data into visual maps like this,

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,395
where red indicates pollutants in the water.

65
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,460
Over a decade ago,

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,515
The entire stream was lined with red,

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
but now the red has vanished.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,140
The overall local water quality has improved from Category IV to Category II, transforming into crystal-clear streams,

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,220
where over twenty rafting spots have emerged.

70
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,595
Summer tourism revenue alone now exceeds 200 million yuan.

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,720
What about the water back then,

72
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,780
it was pitch black,

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,060
the same color as the soy sauce in your home,

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,940
that's exactly how dark it was.

75
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,880
Now you can jump in anywhere,

76
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,145
You can even swim here,

77
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,245
Satellites have captured more changes from space.

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,640
Twenty years ago,

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,280
the mountains were dotted with over seventy mining sites and cement plants.

80
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,660
Today, the highly polluting chemical plants are goneâ€”transformed into zero-carbon rural libraries and exhibition halls.

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,745
It now attracts over 1.2 million tourists annually.

82
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,850
This site, once Anji's largest limestone quarry, has been ecologically restored and

83
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,585
transformed into a scenic eco-resort with lush hills and water features,

84
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
selling over 8,000 cups of coffee daily at peak times,

85
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,755
matching nearly a year's revenue from its former mining operations.

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,340
Today in Anji, the stone-based economy has been replaced by a green economy,

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,835
with the county's GDP soaring from 8.896 billion yuan to 67.557 billion yuan.

88
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
proving that "clear waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,"

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,760
This philosophy has spread nationwide from its origins in Anji,

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,065
evolving into a societal consensus and guiding principle for action.

91
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,910
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

92
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,030
ecological civilization construction has been advancing comprehensively,

93
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,710
people have tackled pollution,

94
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,070
healed ecological scars,

95
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,370
and safeguarded nature with ecological conservation redlines,

96
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,010
integrating green transformation into production and daily life,

97
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,090
ecological conservation has achieved historic and transformative

98
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,470
changes on all fronts,

99
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,490
preserving our lucid waters and lush mountains,

100
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,430
across 9.6 million square kilometers of land,

101
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,915
The land now teems with vibrant green development.

102
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,030
Along the eastern foothills of Helan Mountain in Ningxia,

103
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,950
what was once a barren gravel wasteland has been restored,

104
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,230
transforming into China's largest contiguous wine grape growing region.

105
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,430
Lush greenery now stretches as far as the eye can see,

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,005
The economic returns are now substantially higher than before.

107
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,790
At the foot of Langshan Mountain in Shaoyang, Hunan, rice farmers have reserved foraging areas in their paddies for the cranes,

108
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,890
while strictly controlling pesticide and chemical fertilizer use,

109
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,790
successfully preserving the cranes' wetland habitat.

110
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,190
The rice produced here has become more sought-after in the market.

111
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,870
The rice fields cover 300 mu,

112
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,830
growing the Zhu Huan rice variety,

113
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,030
which sells for three yuan more per jin than regular rice.

114
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,290
Annually,

115
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,085
this brings in an additional 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

116
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,960
In the tranquil forests of Sanming, Fujian,

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,315
life bursts forth in glorious bloom during summer.

118
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,950
Dendrobium officinale enters its maturation phase,

119
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,350
alongside golden-threaded lotus, multiflowered goldenseal, and crimson mushrooms,

120
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,815
transforming the entire forest into a treasure trove of sustenance.

121
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,190
These wild medicinal herbs and mountain vegetables growing in the forest,

122
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,750
generate an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan.

123
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,770
In the past, we'd just chop some wood in these woods to earn a little money.

124
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,830
Now we're developing Ningxia's economy through

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,570
tourism initiatives,

126
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,710
During peak seasons,

127
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,475
we receive multiple groups of visitors daily.

128
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,920
If we protect the green mountains,

129
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,705
they will surely reward us in return.

130
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,200
Today, China has launched its first national pilot program for realizing the value of ecological products across twelve regions,

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
over 300 eco-tourism routes,

132
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,675
generating market vitality exceeding one trillion yuan.

133
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
The lush forests,

134
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,400
the fresh air,

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,285
and clean water sources are being transformed into tangible ecological commodities.

136
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,440
A sound ecological environment is the most inclusive form of public welfare.

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,260
The vivid practice of "lucid waters and lush mountains being invaluable assets"

138
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,025
is continuously writing new chapters.

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,420
At the instruction of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,220
Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,940
Vice Premier of the State Council Zhang Guoqing, representing the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,

142
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, representing the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, led relevant department officials to Yuzhong County in Lanzhou, Gansu Province on the evening of the 8th to direct on-site search and rescue operations and emergency response efforts for the mountain flood disaster.

143
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,720
Zhang Guoqing visited Maliantan Village in Mapo Township, the hardest-hit area,

144
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,180
Zhang Guoqing visited Maliantan Village in Mapo Township, Jiuzhuanggou Village, and the temporary shelter for relocated residents at Yuzhong County First People's Hospital,

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,860
conducting thorough investigations into search and rescue operations,

146
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,820
medical treatment for the injured,

147
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,860
the relocation and resettlement of affected residents, and other relief efforts.

148
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,160
Subsequently, he convened a meeting at the on-site command center,

149
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,600
to discuss and arrange support for Gansu's disaster relief and rescue operations.

150
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,380
He emphasized that,

151
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
General Secretary Xi Jinping has shown deep concern,

152
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,340
being deeply concerned about the safety of affected residents,

153
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,340
and has paid close attention to the progress of emergency rescue and relief efforts,

154
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,540
repeatedly stressing that

155
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,480
protecting people's lives must remain the top priority.

156
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,120
making every effort to search for and rescue missing individuals,

157
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,200
relocating and resettling,

158
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,220
residents in threatened areas,

159
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,500
and promptly restoring communication and transportation,

160
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,420
enhancing risk forecasting and early warnings,

161
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,530
strengthen the identification and rectification of potential hazards,

162
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,610
reinforce emergency duty shifts,

163
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,330
and issued clear directives to ensure public safety during the disaster season.

164
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,730
Premier Li Qiang issued instructions,

165
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,170
regarding rescue operations,

166
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,010
evacuation and relocation,

167
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,570
restoration of damaged facilities,

168
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,030
and enhanced disaster prevention and response measures.

169
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:39,410
Gansu Province and all relevant parties must resolutely implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the requirements of Premier Li Qiang,

170
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,690
and carry out targeted flood prevention and disaster relief efforts,

171
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,090
to minimize casualties and disaster losses.

172
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,650
Zhang Guoqing stressed that

173
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,510
With extreme weather events occurring frequently in recent times,

174
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,190
efforts must be made to improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasts regarding location, intensity, and timing,

175
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,590
and provide early warnings with sufficient lead time.

176
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,150
We must closely monitor areas prone to mountain torrent disasters,

177
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,790
geological hazard hotspots and other high-risk zones, as well as dangerous periods like nighttime heavy rainfall,

178
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,170
strictly implement early warning response mechanisms and emergency evacuation measures,

179
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,835
and ensure timely and thorough relocation when disasters strike.

180
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,530
All localities and departments have thoroughly implemented the important directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

181
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,510
continue to carry out all flood prevention and disaster relief work with full effort,

182
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,875
ensuring the public's safe passage through the flood season.

183
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,170
Since August 7th,

184
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,110
Lanzhou City in Gansu Province,

185
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,870
Yuzhong County and other areas have been hit by continuous heavy rainfall,

186
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,310
triggering mountain flood disasters,

187
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,110
affecting eight townships.

188
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,090
In Maliantan Village of Yuzhong County, the hardest-hit area,

189
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,330
rescue teams advanced on foot with equipment,

190
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,610
conducting overnight door-to-door search operations.

191
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,010
local stationed troops and militia,

192
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,630
the National Northwest Regional Emergency Rescue Center,

193
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,390
local rescue personnel and other forces jointly

194
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,330
continued advancing into severely affected Maliantan Village,

195
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,410
Jiuzhuanggou Village,

196
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,570
and Xinglongshan Village, with teams advancing along the river channels in separate groups,

197
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,310
intensifying search and rescue efforts for missing persons.

198
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,030
Currently,

199
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,270
on-site rescue operations are underway under urgent conditions.

200
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,305
We will resolutely implement the important directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

201
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,040
We will prioritize the search and rescue of missing individuals as our most urgent task at present.

202
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,640
As long as there remains the slightest hope,

203
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,580
we will never cease medical treatment for the injured,

204
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,760
while evacuation and relocation efforts for affected residents are also being intensified.

205
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,900
In Lanzhou,

206
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
At the First People's Hospital of Yuzhong County,

207
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,880
fifteen successfully rescued individuals are currently receiving treatment.

208
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
Most of them sustained soft tissue abrasions,

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
fractures, and other external injuries,

210
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,840
and are now in stable condition.

211
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,960
The Gansu Provincial Health Commission has deployed 26 medical specialists from various departments across six provincial-level hospitals to participate in rescue operations in Yuzhong County.

212
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,520
Currently, Yuzhong County has requisitioned hotels,

213
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,240
along with 54 temporary schools and village committees serving as 14 centralized relocation sites,

214
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,060
having relocated and accommodated a total of 9,800 affected residents.

215
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,300
Many evacuees were transferred here starting from around 8 pm last night,

216
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,940
Upon arrival, staff immediately arranged dinner for them,

217
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,260
which consisted of four stir-fried dishes.

218
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,180
This morning's meal was even more substantial,

219
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,980
with all aspects of support being exceptionally well-provided.

220
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,940
The heaviest rainfall was recorded at Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong County.

221
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,330
Currently, emergency crews are racing to reopen Provincial Highway S104 - the main route connecting the county town to Xinglong Mountain.

222
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,150
Rescue teams are continuously reinforcing the roadbed along this section,

223
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,710
while clearing mudslides and debris.

224
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,570
As of 6 PM today,

225
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,630
80% of power supply has been restored in the affected areas,

226
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,310
Communication services have been largely restored.

227
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,710
The Office of the Committee for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Relief,

228
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,790
the Ministry of Emergency Management,

229
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,490
and the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration

230
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,770
have allocated

231
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,370
including 10,000 relief items such as folding beds, cotton-padded quilts, and emergency lighting equipment.

232
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,630
These central disaster relief supplies

233
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,730
will assist local authorities in further strengthening emergency relocation/resettlement and disaster relief efforts for affected residents.

234
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,890
The Ministry of Finance

235
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,790
and the Ministry of Emergency Management have urgently allocated 120 million yuan in central natural disaster relief funds,

236
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,590
to support relief efforts in Gansu and Inner Mongolia,

237
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,870
with priority given to search/rescue operations and temporary relocation,

238
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,770
secondary disaster risk screening and emergency mitigation by affected residents,

239
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,690
and repair of damaged civil defense facilities.

240
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,050
Currently, we remain in the critical "late July to early August" flood season period.

241
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,670
To ensure public safety,

242
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,410
we're supervising localities to take proactive measures.

243
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,160
Today, Zhengzhou in Henan issued a yellow rainstorm alert,

244
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,840
where drainage pipelines have been cleared in advance,

245
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,340
catch basins dredged,

246
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,460
For flood-prone areas within the urban district,

247
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,560
relevant departments have also pre-deployed drainage pipelines,

248
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,240
and large mobile pumping vehicles.

249
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,540
Resolutely implementing the important directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

250
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,160
enhancing risk forecasting and early warnings,

251
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,880
strengthening the identification and rectification of potential hazards,

252
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,560
enhancing emergency duty shifts,

253
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,840
resolutely shouldering the political responsibility for flood prevention and disaster relief,

254
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,240
ensuring the safety of cities and the well-being of residents.

255
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,800
The National Meteorological Center forecasts that,

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,500
Over the next three days,

257
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,460
as the main rain belt shifts southward, heavy rainfall will affect regions from Sichuan

258
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,020
through Chongqing to Jiangsu

259
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,800
and Anhui.

260
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,335
The public should remain vigilant against severe convection weather and secondary disasters.

261
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,590
This station reports: To implement the important directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the Central Organization Department

262
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,570
has allocated 32 million yuan from the centrally managed Party funds to Gansu

263
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,730
and Guangxi provinces to support flood prevention and disaster relief efforts.

264
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,100
Tibet's natural landscapes,

265
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,620
along with its abundant and diverse cultural resources,

266
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,960
serves as a vital conservation area for distinctive Chinese ethnic culture,

267
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
and a premier global tourism destination.

268
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,540
In today's special report series "60 Years of Splendor: The New Charm of Tibet",

269
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,580
let us journey into the snowy plateau,

270
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,380
to explore how Tibet leverages its unique resources,

271
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,960
promoting the integrated development of culture and tourism,

272
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,265
to help local residents prosper.

273
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,160
Deep in the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains,

274
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
at the foot of Mount Sapu in Nagqu, Tibet,

275
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,940
performers staged the Dabuxian dance.

276
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,060
This dance, which evolved from labor scenes,

277
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,500
is recognized as national intangible cultural heritage.

278
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,200
Watching this unique live performance at the foot of snow-capped mountains

279
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,165
offers visitors an immersive intangible heritage experience.

280
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,030
Building on these distinctive resources,

281
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,710
The local government is actively developing new cultural tourism consumption experiences.

282
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,690
Here, visitors from afar can gallop on horseback while sightseeing and capturing travel photos,

283
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,870
immersing themselves in unique natural landscapes and cultural charm.

284
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,130
In July this year,

285
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,050
the Sapu Scenic Area was officially certified as

286
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,830
a national AAAA-level tourist attraction,

287
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,190
receiving 16,600 visitors in the first half of the year,

288
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,710
marking a 150% increase compared to last year.

289
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,810
Although I've visited Tibet five times,

290
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,830
seeing it up close like this

291
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,610
Seeing Sapu still leaves me utterly awestruck.

292
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,670
This once-remote plateau wonder now welcomes more visitors with open arms,

293
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,390
while enabling locals to thrive through tourism right at their doorstep.

294
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,010
At 4,100 meters above sea level, the Tricolor Lake lies in Banbar County of Qamdo,

295
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,250
consisting of the White Lake,

296
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,590
the Yellow Lake, and the Black Lake.

297
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,490
The Tricolor Hot Springs are located in Puyu Village near the Tricolor Lake,

298
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,610
a village embraced by glaciers and lakes,

299
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,190
once the most isolated place in the surrounding area.

300
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,050
In recent years, with continuous improvements in infrastructure,

301
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,490
Particularly last September,

302
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,220
when National Highway 319 was fully opened to traffic,

303
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,740
the drive from here to Lhasa was shortened by nearly four hours.

304
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,060
The number of tourists visiting Three-Color Lake has surged exponentially,

305
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,940
bringing transformative changes to the villagers' lives.

306
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
My home is in Puyu Village,

307
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,300
the first guesthouse in the area,

308
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,680
My name is Dianji Diexina,

309
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
This is my father,

310
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
He's working on stone carvings,

311
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,460
That's my grandmother Puyu,

312
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,380
She comes here every afternoon for tea.

313
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,160
This is the most fun swing in our home.

314
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,860
Seven-year-old Dengzeng Dexi is the little star of the guesthouse,

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,020
His father Dorje is a painter,

316
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,920
Five years ago, he opened the village's first Tibetan-style guesthouse.

317
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,400
Today, the guesthouse earns an annual income of 100,000 yuan,

318
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,660
Last year alone,

319
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,140
Puyu Village's tourism revenue exceeded six million yuan,

320
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,340
With an average household increase of over 20,000 yuan.

321
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,980
This year's situation is even better,

322
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,420
with fifty or sixty,

323
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,090
earning six hundred yuan a day is quite substantial. By integrating local scenery with distinctive culture,

324
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,510
we're building Thangka villages,

325
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,350
woodcarving villages,

326
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,690
Tibetan-style villages, ethnic township villages and other distinctive rural communities,

327
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,990
and developing more premium tourism routes and products.

328
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,650
Since entering the new era,

329
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,470
Tibet has been thoroughly exploring and utilizing its cultural resources,

330
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,450
promoting the integrated development of culture and tourism,

331
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,790
The cultural tourism industry has shown vigorous development momentum.

332
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,050
Statistics show that,

333
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,510
in 2024, the region received over 63.89 million domestic and international tourists,

334
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,270
with total tourism expenditure exceeding 74.6 billion yuan.

335
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,035
representing year-on-year growth of 15.8% and 14.5% respectively.

336
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,590
For national liberation and world peace,

337
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,530
the thematic exhibition commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War,

338
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,970
has been open to the public.

339
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,810
Over the past month,

340
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,490
visitor numbers have surpassed 300,000.

341
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,670
The exhibition hall displays personal letters from General Zuo Quan among other artifacts.

concerning the security issues of the European continent,

Asian economies will remain the primary engine of global goods trade growth in 2025,

545
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,210

553
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,360
and fisheries export industries.

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,960
Lula emphasized at this juncture,

555
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,920
that the United States should learn to respect other countries' sovereignty and judicial rights.

556
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,100
The United States had previously announced the imposition of additional tariffs on Brazil,

targeting locations within Israel,

563
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:20,430
with the stated objective of supporting Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, while Republicans governing Texas in the U.S.

564
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,540
aim to solidify their party's majority in the U.S. Congress

565

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,030
The fires have claimed at least one life so far.

580
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,750
