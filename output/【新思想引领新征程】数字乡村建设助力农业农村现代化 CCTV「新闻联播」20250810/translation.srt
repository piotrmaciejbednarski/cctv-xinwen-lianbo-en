147
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,220
Swinging on a swing feeding big geese,

148
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,520
Who would have thought this was inside a steel factory in production in Xingtai.

149
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,600

The air is choking people,

156
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,900
The air was once a deep pain for Xingtai.

157
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,160
Two thousand thirteen,

158
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,960
Among the seventy-four key monitored cities nationwide,

159
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,205
Xingtai ranks last.

160
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,430
This was Delong Steel Plant photographed by the environmental monitoring satellite at that time,

161
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,450
When the smog was at its most severe,

162
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,345
The outline of the factory area was almost indistinguishable.

163
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,080

Tsinghua University research team used olfactory visualization technology to restore the evolution process of odors.

175
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,810

176
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,810
This is PM ten, this kind of particulate matter has a very high content.

177
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,630
There is also the smell of burnt match heads and disinfectant.

178
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,090
This belongs to sulfur dioxide,

179
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,830
The nitrogen dioxide content is very high.

180
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,630
Over the past ten years the content of these pollutants has sharply declined,

181
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,390
Now not only can one not smell these unpleasant odors,

182
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,690
At the same time, during our experiments, we will detect more and more pyrene,

183
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,310
Limonene and other compounds,

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,300
Then these are behind the changes in the fragrant smell emitted by flowers, plants, and trees,

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,360
It is the increasingly precise footsteps of China's air governance.

186
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,480
In Beijing,

187
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,840
A precise integrated space air ground sensing network,

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,100
More than three thousand road networks, two hundred thousand heavy diesel vehicles, more than two thousand construction sites, and thousands of enterprises that abandon their facilities are included in the monitoring,

189
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,700
Every day, hundreds of millions of data points are collected.

190
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,135
Expand precise governance.

191
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,470
These years then,

192
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:40,330
Beijing's PM 2.5 annual average concentration has already decreased from nearly ninety micrograms per cubic meter to thirty point five micrograms.

193
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,670
But if you want to further improve it, you need zero point one micrograms.

194
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,990
Zero point one microgram of Qu Kou,

195
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,090
Seize every possibility for improvement.

196
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,315
We analyzed the air data released by three hundred and thirty-nine cities over ten years,

197
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,030
It was discovered that PM 2.5 in every cubic meter of air decreased by nearly 40 percent.

198
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,015
The average number of days with blue skies in each city that followed increased by twenty-two days.

199
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,890
Present-day China,

200
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,630
Blue skies and white clouds are no longer a luxury,

201
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,910
People can directly look at Beijing from the rooftops of buildings in Tianjin,

202
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,765
In Chengdu's Central Business District, one can photograph the beautiful snow-capped mountains two hundred kilometers away from one's doorstep.

203
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,930
The number of stargazing spots announced in various places has increased twentyfold compared to two thousand sixteen.

204
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,430
Now blue skies and white clouds are not a new thing anymore,

205
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,610
To catch up with the smoggy weather,

206
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,290
That would be news.

207
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,530
Originally, when I saw the blue sky, I wanted to take a picture.

208
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,970
Not anymore.

209
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,990
There is an evening glow.

210
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,830
Rainbow ah,

211
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,030
We just took a picture.

212
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,350
Now the air is better,

213
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,965
Our aesthetics have all improved.

214
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,780
Ningxia Zhongwei Liaoning Dalian

215
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,600
In the study and implementation of the spirit of the Central Eight Provisions,

216
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,980
Persist in listening to opinions with an open door,

217
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,600
Thoroughly investigate and research

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,920
Advance Rectification

219
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
Practice yields results.

220
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,020
Ensure the outcomes of the study education,

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,625
Make it tangible and accessible to the masses.

222
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,890
Since the launch of the study education,

223
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,470
The city of Zhongwei, Ningxia organized a large number of party members to go deep into the park enterprises,

224
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,290
Help them resolve practical problems in development.

225
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,070
At the same time, cadres were selected and dispatched to follow up on major project services throughout the entire process.

226
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,190
Extend window processing to on-site service.

227
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,730
This big data industrial park under construction in the Zhongwei City Industrial Park,

228
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,650
With the help of a service specialist,

229
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,230
Approval achieves significant compression efficiency,

230
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,090
Increased by one third compared to the original.

231
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,470
The entire process,

232
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,210
The government also did a lot of work,

233
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,010
To understand the problems through one on one service for our enterprise,

234
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,510
Solving problems is very practical.

235
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,230
At present,

236
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,690
Zhongwei City thoroughly investigates rural revitalization,

237
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,450
Issues in areas such as people's livelihood and improving social governance,

238

Conscientiously transform the effectiveness of study and education into problem-solving,

240
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,830
Serving the people,

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,590
Actual actions to promote high-quality development.

242
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,630
My comrades, we will thoroughly study and comprehend the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions.

243
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,885
Guide the vast number of Party members and cadres to follow the Party's mass line well in the new era.

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,400
To promote a change in work style by solving problems,

Assisting high quality development.

252
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,640
This private aquaculture processing enterprise has difficulty recruiting people during the peak season,

253
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,500
Excellent talent cannot retain cadres who have entered the enterprise.

254
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,700
Through on-site visits,

255
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,180

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
Each email on average saves five hours of customs clearance time.

346
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,540
It saves time,

347
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,760
It also reduced the economic burden of previous entrustments for handling.

348
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,680
We always regard promoting the facilitation of cross-border trade as an important抓手,

349
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,120
Continuously advance the application process,

350
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,340
Simplifying and upgrading the port's intelligent supervision system while holding the safety bottom line,

351
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,020
Improve customs clearance efficiency.

352
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,860

354
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,020
Further stimulate the vitality of foreign trade,

355
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,975
Promote Chinese goods to better integrate into the global supply chain.

356
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,710
For days, all regions and departments have resolutely implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions.

357
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,450
We must do targeted work in flood control and disaster relief,

358
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,565
Fully guarantee the safety of people's lives and property.

359
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,870
Today, in Yuzhong County, Lanzhou, Gansu, the search and rescue of missing persons is being intensified.

360
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,969
Team members are divided into groups along the severely affected Malian Beach Village,

361
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,470

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,590
and use drones to carry out aeromagnetic surveys,

363
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,330
More accurately locking down the search and rescue area and disaster-stricken areas, infrastructure restoration continues to advance.

364
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,230
As of now,

365
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,590
All main power lines in the area have been restored.

366
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,650
The next step will be to enter the power grid reconstruction phase.

367
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,530
Through methods such as setting up base stations for communication support and maintenance,

368
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,890
Voice calls in severely affected villages have mostly returned to normal.

369
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,630

Can quickly enter the disaster-stricken area.

375
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,570
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that

Low-lying areas and others are to be fully investigated.

408
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,150
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that

409
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,550
We must resolutely overcome the thinking of carelessness and overconfidence,

410
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,770
We will closely monitor weather changes,

At the same time, effectively ensure the daily lives of the transferred people.

414
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:27,770
At present,

415
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,150
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has already targeted Jiangsu,

416
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,330

The Party Member Commando Team, after more than one hour of maneuvering,

428
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,970
Upon arriving at Mapo Township, one of the most severely affected areas, all roads leading into the disaster zone were washed away.

429
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,470
The commandos could only carry shovels,

430
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,270
Hiking to Jiuzhuangou Village,

431
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,270
While clearing the mud, rocks, and trees resulting from the landslide,

432
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,450
While transporting other large obstacles,

433
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,750
Clear time is life itself,

434
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,110
As long as we are one minute faster,

435
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,735
The safety of the people will increase by one point.

436
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,710
In Jiuzhuanggou Village,

437
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,210
Most houses in Yishe and Ershe have been destroyed by the mountain flood.

438

440
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,630
Escorting the transfer of the masses, a river bridge was destroyed.

441
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,810
Party member shock troops urgently erected a simple bridge,

442
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,770

At that time, there was a team of militia standing in the river water,

444
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,905
Including the day we shared, carrying the elderly and children, drinking,

445
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,130
Walked all along,

446
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,390
Six miles took me to the specialized point,

447
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,385
Without them, they would not have our life safety.

448
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,930
Night falls,

449
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,950
The Party member commando team could not take a rest,

450
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,330

451
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,110

452
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,210
Materials such as folding beds were moved in,

453
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,990
Traveling back and forth between the supply point and the centralized resettlement site.

454
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,790
At that time everyone had only one thought in their minds,

455
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,710
No matter what difficulties there are,

456
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,110
The disaster-stricken people must be fed,

457
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,090
We cannot let them starve meal after meal.

458
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:28,930
At present,

459
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,350
