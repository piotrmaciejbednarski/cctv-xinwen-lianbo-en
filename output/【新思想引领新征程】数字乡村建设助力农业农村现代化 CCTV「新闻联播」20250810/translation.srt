making them perceptible and accessible to the public.

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,390
The first comprehensive rehearsal for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War concluded successfully.

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,690
In the first half of this year, China's light industry output above designated size grew by 7.0% year-on-year,

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,970
with revenue exceeding 11 trillion yuan.

32
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,980

Digital villages represent the strategic direction for rural revitalization.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,280
President Xi Jinping emphasized that

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,700
we must seize the opportunities of digitalization,

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,540
networking,

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560

00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,940
to advance the digital transformation of manufacturing,

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,660
the service sector,

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
agriculture and other industries.

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,700
Since the beginning of this year,

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,020
regions across the country have accelerated the development of digital villages,

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,240
focusing on improving agricultural efficiency,

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,620
revitalizing rural areas,

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,880
increasing farmers' incomes—managing hundreds of acres of farmland with just a smartphone.

53
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,530
A single rural livestream

54
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,850
can help village agricultural products reach markets far and wide.

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,290
Digital technologies enter villages,

56
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,370
Many tasks can now be handled without leaving the village.

57
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,810
digital industries,

58
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,830
digital governance,

59
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,850
digital services for people's livelihoods,

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,075
Digital technologies are transforming the production and lifestyles in rural China.

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,240
President Xi Jinping has placed great emphasis on the development of digital villages.

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,140
He stressed the need to focus on the primary direction of agricultural modernization,

63
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,920
enhancing intelligent agricultural production and networked operations.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) and

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,880
other modern information technologies like big data to develop smart agriculture.

66
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,320
The General Secretary emphasized that

67
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,460
modern information technologies should be effectively leveraged to innovate rural governance methods,

68
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,560
thereby elevating the level of sound rural governance.

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,620
In implementing the General Secretary's directives, the Digital Village initiative has been consecutively included in the Central No. 1 Documents since 2018,

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,180
with successive releases of the Digital Village Construction Guidelines versions 1.0 and 2.0,

71
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,020
establishing the fundamental framework for China's digital village development.

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,460
Currently, broadband coverage has reached 100% of administrative villages nationwide,

73
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,960
with over 90% having 5G access, and the rural internet user population reaching 322 million.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Meanwhile,

75
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,720
the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System,

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,220
the construction of major data infrastructure including high-resolution Earth observation systems,

77
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,550
provides technological support for rural digitalization initiatives.

78
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:33,765
Well,

79
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,210
this year has seen further acceleration in rural digital development.

80
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,810
In March, eight key provinces including Zhejiang,

81
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,950
Anhui, Fujian,

82
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,270
Henan, Chongqing,

83
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,810
and Sichuan launched a special digital rural development initiative to strengthen agriculture, benefit farmers, and boost rural prosperity.

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,850
In May 2025,

85
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,550
the Digital Rural Development Guidelines were issued.

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,050
In the first half of this year,

87
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,170
China's e-commerce transaction volume for agricultural products grew by 17.2%.

88
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,550
Behind this growth,

89
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,410
lies the support of over 300,000 integrated village-level logistics service stations across the country,

90
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,150
The digital rural development initiative

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,970
has given rise to a thriving rural e-commerce industrial chain.

92
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,850
This is Xinhua Village in Cangxi County, Sichuan,

93
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,710
Now, with just an internet connection

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,410
and a smartphone, this small mountain village is connected to the world.

95
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,310
The village's specialty Cuiguan pears are reaching customers nationwide through livestream sales.

96
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,110
Meanwhile, across the entire Cangxi County,

97
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,410
virtually every village now has digital-savvy officials

98
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,410
who can film and host livestreams to promote local products,

99
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,450
along with a new generation of farmers specializing in product selection,

100
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,370
supply chain management, and after-sales services.

101
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,440
We will subsequently develop integrated models combining e-commerce with industrial e-commerce, rural tourism,

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,700
cultural and creative industries,

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,660
nurturing rural operation specialists,

104
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,520
agricultural innovators, and other new-generation farmers,

105
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,340
empowering our rural areas through digital means,

106
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,280
advancing digital governance in rural areas.

107
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,700
Now villagers can handle many municipal affairs without leaving their village.

108
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,560
In Yantao Village, Changxing County, Zhejiang,

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
villager Zhang Zhemin used the integrated government service machine,

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,460
and completed the modification of his medical insurance enrollment information in just five minutes.

111
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,540
Last year,

112
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,880
this procedure still required bringing documents to the county office for processing.

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,780
This year, Zhejiang is accelerating the implementation of its "one-network" digital rural governance system,

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,200
striving to achieve online application rates for provincial-level matters,

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,700
online processing rates,

116
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,020
online service completion rates,

117
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,980
zero in-person visits,

118
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,640
fulfillment rates,

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,740
and 100% electronic document usage—all five metrics,

120
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,460
ensuring rural and urban residents enjoy equal-quality services.

121
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
advancing urban-rural integration scenarios.

122
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,480
We will enhance the "one-network management" system,

123
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,440
enable one-click direct access,

124
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,440
and explore more AI-powered scenarios,

125
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,470
ensuring data not only flows swiftly,

126
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,490
but also flows accurately,

127
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,390
but also delivers tangible value,

128
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,210
enhancing the precision of rural governance while increasing villagers' sense of fulfillment

129
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,930
and well-being.

130
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,250
According to the plan,

131
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,630
By 2035,

132
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,370
significant progress will be made in digital rural development.

133
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,010
The urban-rural digital divide will be substantially narrowed,

134
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,750
farmers' digital literacy will be markedly improved,

135
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,970
driving comprehensive rural revitalization,

136
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,410
building a robust agricultural sector,

137
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,430
creating beautiful countryside,

138
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,190
and enabling prosperous farmers—air quality is closely linked to people's livelihoods.

139
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,170
President Xi Jinping emphasized that

140
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,190
we must restore clear skies and

141
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,390
a starry sky.

142
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,170
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

143
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,710
China's air pollution control has accelerated remarkably, with increasingly more blue skies and white clouds,

144
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,675
bringing tangible happiness to the people.

145
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,100
Today's perceptible ecological changes,

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,225
Let's take a look at the changes brought about by this blue sky campaign.

147
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,220
Swinging on swings and feeding geese,

148
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,520
Who would have thought this was inside an operational steel plant in Xingtai?

149
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,600
Every weekend,

150
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,920
the influx of visitors,

151
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,980
has brought booming business to the small convenience store by the factory gate.

152
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,040
Drinks, ice pops,

153
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,760
and children's toys are selling like hotcakes.

154
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,820
In the past, nobody wanted to come here,

155
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,140
the air was choking.

156
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,900
The air pollution was once Xingtai's deepest affliction.

157
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,160
In 2013,

158
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,960
among the 74 key monitored cities nationwide,

159
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,205
Xingtai ranked dead last.

160
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,430
This is the Delong Steel Plant captured by environmental monitoring satellites at the time,

161
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,450
At the peak of the smog crisis,

162
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,345
the factory complex was barely discernible,

163
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,080
yet now it stands clearly visible.

164
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,285
Verdant greenery thrives.

165
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,825
The transformation in the steel industry epitomizes China's victorious battle for blue skies.

166
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,190
To restore blue skies for its people,

167
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,590
China has successively launched air pollution prevention campaigns,

168
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,430
including the three-year Blue Sky Protection Campaign and ongoing air quality improvement initiatives.

169
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,850
Since 2013,

170
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,785
the number of heavily polluted days has decreased by over 90%.

171
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,285
China has become the country with the fastest air quality improvement rate in the world,

172
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,440
blue skies are becoming more frequent,

173
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,165
and the scents in the air are also undergoing noticeable changes.

174
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,635
A Tsinghua University research team has reconstructed this olfactory evolution process using smell visualization technology.

175
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,810
A decade ago, we could frequently detect this coal-smoke odor,

176
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,810
This indicates extremely high concentrations of PM10 particulate matter,

177
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,630
along with odors resembling burnt matchsticks and disinfectant,

178
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,090
which are characteristic of sulfur dioxide,

179
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,830
and nitrogen dioxide levels were also notably elevated.

180
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,630
Over the past decade, concentrations of these pollutants have significantly declined,

181
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,390
Nowadays, not only are these unpleasant odors no longer detectable,

182
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,690
but during our experiments, we're also increasingly detecting compounds like pinene

183
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,310
and limonene.

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,300
These substances represent the fragrant scents emitted by plants and trees—a shift that reflects

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,360
China's increasingly precise strides in air pollution control.

186
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,480
In Beijing,

187
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,840
an integrated air-space-ground monitoring network

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,100
tracks over 3,000 roadways, 200,000 heavy-duty diesel vehicles, 2,000+ construction sites, and thousands of industrial facilities,

189
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,700
collecting hundreds of millions of data points daily,

190
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,135
enabling targeted pollution control measures.

191
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,470
Over these years,

192
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:40,330
Beijing's annual average PM2.5 concentration has decreased from nearly 90 micrograms per cubic meter to 30.5 micrograms.

193
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,670
But to achieve further improvement, we now need to focus on every 0.1 microgram reduction,

194
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,990
meticulously working to shave off each 0.1 microgram,

195
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,090
seizing every possible opportunity for improvement.

196
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,315
We analyzed air quality data published over ten years from 339 cities,

197
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,030
finding that PM2.5 levels per cubic meter of air had decreased by nearly 40%.

198
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,015
Consequently, the average number of blue-sky days per city increased by 22 days.

199
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,890
In today's China,

200
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,630
clear blue skies are no longer a luxury,

201
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,910
From rooftops in Tianjin, people can now see Beijing in the distance,

202
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,765
while in Chengdu's CBD, snow-capped mountains 200 kilometers away are visible right from residents' doorsteps.

203
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,930
The number of publicly designated stargazing spots nationwide has increased twentyfold since 2016.

204
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,430
Blue skies and white clouds are no longer rare sights these days—

205
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,610
encountering smoggy weather, however,

206
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,290
that would be something novel now.

207
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,530
Back then, we'd rush to take pictures whenever we saw blue skies,

208
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,970
but not anymore.

209
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,990
Now it takes a sunset glow,

210
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,830
or a rainbow,

211
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,030
we'd take photos.

212
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,350
Now that the air quality has improved,

213
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,965
our aesthetic standards have also risen.

214
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,780
In Ningxia's Zhongwei and Liaoning's Dalian,

215
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,600
during the in-depth study and implementation of the Central Eight-Point Guidelines,

216
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,980
adhering to open-door policy for soliciting opinions,

217
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,600
conducting thorough investigations and research,

218
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,920
advancing rectification efforts,

219
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
ensuring tangible results in implementation,

220
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,020
to solidify the outcomes of the education campaign,

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,625
making these benefits tangible and accessible to the public.

222
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,890
Since the launch of the education campaign,

223
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,470
Zhongwei City in Ningxia has mobilized Party members to engage with industrial parks and enterprises,

224
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,290
assisting them in resolving practical development challenges.

225
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,070
Concurrently, officials have been assigned to provide end-to-end support for major projects,

226
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,190
extending counter-based procedures to on-site services.

227
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,730
At this big data industrial park currently under construction in Zhongwei Industrial Park,

228
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,650
With the assistance of dedicated service personnel,

229
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,230
approval efficiency has been significantly accelerated,

230
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,090
achieving a one-third improvement over previous standards.

231
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,470
As for the entire process,

232
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,210
the government has also made substantial efforts,

233
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,010
providing one-on-one services to understand our company's issues,

234
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,510
and addressing problems with a pragmatic approach.

235
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,230
Currently,

236
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,690
Zhongwei City has conducted in-depth examinations of issues in rural revitalization,

237
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,450
people's livelihoods, and social governance improvement,

238
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,990
resolving over 1,600 public complaints and appeals.

239
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,810
The city has effectively translated educational achievements into practical solutions,

240
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,830
serving the public,

241
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,590
concrete actions to promote high-quality development.

242
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,630
Comrades have thoroughly studied and understood the important speeches and directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

243
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,885
guiding Party members and officials to better follow the Party's mass line in the new era,

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,400
using problem-solving to drive changes in work style,

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,560
and demonstrating firm support for the "Two Establishments" through concrete actions,

246
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,395
resolutely upholding the "Two Upholds".

247
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,360
During the educational campaign,

248
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,120
Dalian City in Liaoning Province focused on optimizing the business environment,

249
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,520
continuously advancing the initiative of having leading officials engage with projects

250
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,079
and enterprises through special campaigns,

251
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,500
to drive high-quality development.

252
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,640
This private aquatic product processing company struggled with recruitment during peak seasons,

253
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,500
and even assigned enterprise liaison officers couldn't retain top talent.

254
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,700
Through on-site visits,

255
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,180
they helped the company organize dedicated recruitment fairs both online and offline,

256
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,500
while also facilitating partnerships with universities,

257
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,540
encouraging college students to intern and seek employment there,

258
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,120
and establishing a fast-track channel for professional title evaluations.

259
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,560
These comprehensive measures have helped companies attract and retain talent,

260
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,990
providing us with substantial support,

261
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,010
allowing us to experience continuous improvements in the business environment,

262
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,595
and growing confidence in corporate operations.

263
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,110
Currently, Dalian municipal officials have conducted field visits and research at over 10,000 business entities,

264
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,610
establishing specialized service teams for credit finance,

265
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,570
commerce, logistics,

266
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,630
sci-tech talent,

267
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,850
taxation, and eight other specialized service teams,

268
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,110
addressing key and challenging issues through coordination meetings and scheduling sessions.

269
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,830
We have earnestly studied and implemented General Secretary Xi Jinping's important directives on strengthening the Party's conduct construction,

270
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,270
effectively translating educational achievements into tangible results in work implementation,

271
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,995
We have gained public trust through new achievements in improving work conduct.

272
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,160
According to the press center for the 80th anniversary commemorations of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War,

273
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,280
from the night of August 9 to the early hours of August 10,

274
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,720
the first comprehensive rehearsal for the 80th anniversary commemoration of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War was held in Beijing's Tiananmen area, with approximately 22,000 participants involved in the rehearsal and on-site support operations.

275
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,450
It was reported that the first comprehensive rehearsal included the commemorative ceremony,

276
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,535
including the ceremonial proceedings,

277
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,740
with primary focus on coordinating the commemorative assembly,

278
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,260
the internal coordination of all procedural elements,

279
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,860
and comprehensively evaluated the organizational support and operational command from all parties.

280
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,900
The orderly rehearsal successfully achieved its intended objectives.

281
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,880
Beijing authorities stated that

282
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,960
the drill operation has been successfully completed,

283
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,825
expressing sincere gratitude to the public for their understanding and support.

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,460
Data from the China National Light Industry Council shows

285
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,200
China's light industry maintained its upward recovery trend in the first half of the year, continuing the positive momentum since Q4 last year,

286
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
Production showed steady growth,

287
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
with the added value of light industry enterprises above designated size increasing by 7.0% year-on-year,

288
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,580
generating operating revenue of 11.3 trillion yuan.

289
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,940
In terms of the consumer market,

290
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,500
policy-driven effects were notably evident.

291
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,580
In the first half of the year, retail sales of eleven categories of light industrial goods exceeded 4.3 trillion yuan,

292
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
representing an 11.6% year-on-year increase.

293
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,880
This growth was driven by consumer goods,

294
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,960
trade-in policies,

295
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,980
electric bicycles,

296
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,000
household appliances, freezers,

297
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,840
washing machines,

298
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,180
gas stoves and other products achieved double-digit production growth.

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,100
As policies continued to intensify and expand in scope,

300
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,780
consumer potential was steadily unleashed,

301
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,000
household appliances and audiovisual equipment,

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,900
retail sales of furniture products grew by 30.7%

303
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,460
and 22.9% year-on-year respectively,

304
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,200
maintaining the robust growth momentum seen since the beginning of the year.

305
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,700
On the industrial upgrading front,

306
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
In the first half of the year, light industrial products accelerated their shift toward premium

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
and intelligent development,

308
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,900
with digitization among major light industrial enterprises

309
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,900
reaching an 86.2% adoption rate for R&D tools,

310
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,030
effectively driving large-scale production of high-value-added products.

311
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,850
Moreover, light industry exports have maintained their resilience.

312
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,610
In the first half of the year,

313
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:26,770
light industry exports reached $456.8 billion, with 11 out of 21 major sectors achieving year-on-year growth in export value.

314
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,530
Since the beginning of this year,

315
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,150
China has continued to advance trade facilitation measures,

316
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,050
has rolled out a series of practical measures,

317
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,695
effectively promoting both the stabilization and quality improvement of foreign trade.

318
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,930
The Fujian Pilot Free Trade Zone, leveraging the International Trade Single Window,

319
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,950
pioneered a smart service platform for RCEP tariff policies,

320
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:51,070
enabling instant approval and issuance of certificates of origin.

321
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,110
Fujian enterprises have independently issued origin declarations for export goods worth over 2.4 billion yuan this year,

322
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,430
ranking first nationally,

323
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,330
providing strong support for businesses expanding into RCEP markets.

324
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,590
In Qingdao, Shandong Province,

325
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,630
customs authorities are actively advancing a new supervision model of "single document, single container" for rail-sea intermodal transport,

326
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,730
Companies can complete customs clearance procedures for goods at inland ports,

327
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,870
including inspection and other formalities.

328
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,650
After being transported to the port via rail-sea intermodal trains,

329
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,470
the goods can be directly loaded onto ships without container transfers throughout the entire process,

330
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,250
eliminating redundant declarations with a single bill of lading for end-to-end customs clearance.

331
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,330
Since the beginning of this year,

332
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,970
Qingdao Port has handled over 1.74 million TEUs of rail-sea intermodal transport,

333
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,890
representing a 13% year-on-year increase,

334
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,710
maintaining its position as the top coastal port nationwide.

335
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,970
In Dalian, Liaoning Province,

336
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,630
In the Dalian Pilot Free Trade Zone, addressing the practical needs of lithium battery export enterprises,

337
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,900
authorities have innovatively introduced a reusable packaging inspection model for exported lithium batteries,

338
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,820
solving the high-cost problem of single-use traditional plastic packaging.

339
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,840
This year, the model has already facilitated the use of over 190,000 reusable packaging units,

340
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,600
helping companies save more than 38 million yuan in costs,

341
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,240
promoting the parallel development of eco-friendly packaging and energy conservation.

342
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,780
The national one-stop platform for inbound and outbound mail processing has officially launched.

343
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,100
Over the past month,

344
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,680
more than 90,000 cross-border mail items have been processed,

345
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
with an average clearance time reduction of five hours per item.

346
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,540
saving time

347
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,760
while also reducing the financial burden previously incurred from using agency services.

348
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,680
We have consistently prioritized facilitating cross-border trade as a key initiative,

349
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,120
continuously optimizing the declaration process,

350
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,340
streamlining and upgrading the smart port supervision system while maintaining strict safety standards,

351
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,020
enhancing customs clearance efficiency.

352
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,860
Moving forward,

353
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,560
Customs will continue to expand the coverage of reforms,

354
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,020
further invigorating foreign trade vitality,

355
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,975
facilitating better integration of Chinese goods into global supply chains.

356
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,710
In recent days, all localities and departments have resolutely implemented the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping,

357
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,450
carrying out targeted flood prevention and disaster relief efforts,

358
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,565
making every effort to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

359
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,870
Today, search and rescue operations for missing persons intensified in Yuzhong County, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province.

360
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,969
Rescue teams were divided into groups to search along severely affected areas including Maliantan Village,

361
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,470
as well as Xiaokangying Village, areas downstream of Kanggu Reservoir, and along river channels.

362
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,590
while utilizing drones for aerial magnetic detection,

363
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,330
enabling more precise targeting of search areas as infrastructure repairs in affected zones continue to progress.

364
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,230
As of now,

365
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,590
all major power lines in the area have been fully restored,

366
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,650
The next step will shift to the power grid reconstruction phase.

367
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,530
Through measures such as erecting communication-supporting base stations and conducting repairs,

368
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,890
voice communication in severely affected villages has largely been restored to normal.

369
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,630
Today, the main road from Yuzhong County to Mapo Township—which was heavily impacted—

370
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,070
Provincial Highway S104,

371
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,710
the last flood-damaged section of the road,

372
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,350
allowing heavy machinery,

373
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,970
rescue vehicles, and supplies

374
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,070
to swiftly reach the disaster-stricken areas.

375
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,570
President Xi Jinping emphasized that,

376
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,510
Communications and transportation must be restored as soon as possible,

377
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,870
We immediately mobilized highway departments and related transport enterprises from five surrounding cities

378
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,510
and prefectures,

379
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,880
deploying a total of 130 pieces of machinery and equipment,

380
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,400
and dispatched 670 personnel.

381
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Currently,

382
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,780
all disaster-damaged roads in Yuzhong County have been reopened to traffic.

383
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,100
After the disaster occurred,

384
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,240
the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Finance activated a rapid coordination mechanism,

385
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,220
allocating emergency road restoration subsidy funds,

386
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,440
to support emergency rescue and traffic maintenance efforts.

387
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,140
The Ministry of Water Resources instructed local authorities to conduct damage assessments and emergency repairs on rural water supply projects,

388
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,540
installing temporary water pipelines.

389
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,440
As of now,

390
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Xiaguanying Town,

391
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,720
Three towns including Chengguan Town have fully restored normal water supply for 12,000 residents.

392
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,100
Since yesterday,

393
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,100
parts of Sichuan have experienced heavy to torrential rainfall,

394
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,640
with local authorities today upgrading to issue a heavy rain

395
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,460
yellow warning.

396
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,320
Chengdu railway authorities have suspended some trains bound for Beijing,

397
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,720
Shenzhen, Wenzhou and other destinations,

398
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,800
In some villages and towns of Mianzhu, twelve hours of rainfall

399
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,760
exceeded 200 millimeters at maximum,

400
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,000
prompting local authorities to evacuate and relocate over 200 residents overnight.

401
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,575
Multiple areas in Anhui experienced rainfall today,

402
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,050
with some parts of Jinzhai receiving over 150 millimeters of precipitation within six hours.

403
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,270
The rainfall exceeded 150 millimeters.

404
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,030
Local authorities cordoned off flooded sections of mountain roads,

405
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,410
deploying personnel for round-the-clock monitoring,

406
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,030
while conducting comprehensive inspections of geological hazard sites and

407
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,430
low-lying areas.

408
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,150
President Xi Jinping emphasized that

409
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,550
we must resolutely overcome complacency and negligence,

410
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,770
We will closely monitor weather changes,

411
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,810
mobilize village officials to intensify patrol inspections,

412
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,690
implement warning and precautionary measures at hazard sites,

413
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,645
while ensuring proper daily necessities for relocated residents.

414
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:27,770
Currently,

415
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,150
the National Flood Control Headquarters has activated a Level IV emergency response for Jiangsu,

416
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,330
Anhui, Hubei,

417
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,910
Chongqing, and Sichuan have initiated Level IV flood control emergency responses,

418
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,370
and dispatched task forces to Anhui

419
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,310
and Hubei frontline areas,

420
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,375
to assist in guiding flood prevention efforts.

421
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,580
Following the mountain torrent disaster in Yuzhong County, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province,

422
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,900
over thirty Party members from the Qilihe District Militia Emergency Company in Lanzhou formed a rapid-response team overnight.

423
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,100
They were the first to arrive at the worst-hit village,

424
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,560
evacuating residents and establishing supply channels for relief materials,

425
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,375
and threw themselves fully into emergency rescue operations.

426
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,290
At around 9:00 a.m. on the 8th,

427
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,290
the Party member突击队 (vanguard team) maneuvered for over an hour,

428
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,970
arriving at Mapo Township—one of the worst-hit areas—where all access roads to the disaster zone had been washed away.

429
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,470
The team members had no choice but to shoulder their shovels

430
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,270
and proceed on foot to Jiuzhuanggou Village,

431
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,270
clearing away mud, rocks, and fallen trees from the landslide while

432
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,450
simultaneously moving other large obstacles out of the way.

433
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,750
Every second counts in this rescue operation—

434
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,110
Every minute we save

435
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,735
means greater safety for the people.

436
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,710
In Jiuzhuanggou Village,

437
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,210
most houses in the First and Second Communities had been destroyed by flash floods.

438
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,095
leaving 175 villagers in grave danger,

439
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,690
the Party member突击队 of Lanzhou's Qilihe District Militia Emergency Company and arriving military troops worked together

440
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,630
to evacuate civilians when a river-crossing bridge was washed away,

441
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,810
The Party member突击队 urgently constructed a makeshift bridge,

442
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,770
ensuring the safe passage of residents.

443
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,470
At that time, a team of militiamen stood in the river water,

444
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,905
including the day when some of us carried the elderly and children,

445
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,130
and kept going,

446
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,390
The checkpoint at Liuli Point transferred me to the designated relief site,

447
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,385
Without them, our lives wouldn't be safe.

448
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,930
As night fell,

449
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,950
the Party member task force pressed on without rest,

450
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,330
carrying instant noodles,

451
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,110
bottled water,

452
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,210
folding beds, and other supplies,

453
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,990
shuttling between supply depots and centralized relief shelters.

454
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,790
At that moment, everyone had only one thought in mind:

455
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,710
no matter what difficulties they faced,

456
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,110
The disaster victims must be fed,

457
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,090
and not left to go hungry.

458
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:28,930
Currently,

459
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,350
the Party member突击队 of the militia emergency company remains on the front lines of rescue operations.

460
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,290
They have cleared nearly five kilometers of road silt,

461
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,610
transported nearly 2,000 relief items,

462
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,570
assisted stationed troops in evacuating and resettling nearly 400 affected residents,

463
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,330
salvaged and relocated nearly 100 pieces of disaster-affected supplies,

464
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,605
and transported over 20 tons of relief materials.

465
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,440
As the summer vacation passes its midpoint,

466
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,960
Cultural venues across the country are experiencing peak visitor numbers.

467
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
With exhibitions and activities continuously introducing fresh content,

468
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,300
museums and heritage parks have become not just summer classrooms where people gain knowledge

469
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,280
and experience history firsthand,

470
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,785
but also beloved cultural spaces and tourist destinations for visitors.

471
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,230
At the foot of Helan Mountain in Ningxia,

472
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,690
the Western Xia Mausoleum, which was inscribed on the World Heritage List this July,

473
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,710
has become a must-visit destination on northwest China's summer travel routes.

474
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,990
According to data from the Ningxia Culture and Tourism Department,

475
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,170
ticket reservations for the Western Xia Mausoleum scenic area have surged by 280% year-on-year.

476
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,310
Meanwhile, search popularity for nearby hotels and restaurants continues to rise sharply.

477
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,710
The visitor flow primarily comes from Beijing,

478
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,970
Shanghai, Hangzhou,

479
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,890
and parts of the Yangtze River Delta region in Jiangsu,

480
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,990
the Pearl River Delta, as well as some areas in South China.

481
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,590
During four consecutive summer seasons at the Liangzhu National Archaeological Park in Yuhang, Zhejiang,

482
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,270
the world's first large-scale VR experience based on the ancient Liangzhu city was launched.

483
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,550
Witness how our ancestors built water conservancy projects,

484
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,450
cultivated rice paddies,

485
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,410
and domesticated livestock.

486
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,490
The daily life of Liangzhu ancestors in this watery landscape feels almost within reach.

487
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,390
Here,

488
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,970
the ancient Liangzhu city has been fully digitized

489
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,390
and reconstructed,

490
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,050
allowing us to truly appreciate the remarkable ingenuity of their way of life,

491
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,610
including their jade artifacts,

492
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,070
their pottery works,

493
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,190
It's truly breathtaking.

494
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,040
Meanwhile, museums across China have launched new exhibitions this summer,

495
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,260
fostering increasingly diverse cultural exchanges,

496
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
breaking geographical barriers to reach wider audiences.

497
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,520
The Guangdong Museum has launched a new exhibition on the ritual and musical culture of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties,

498
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,140
featuring artifacts on loan from the Henan Museum,

499
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,540
the Wangziwu Ding, and other significant cultural relics.

500
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,380
Meanwhile, the China National Silk Museum in Hangzhou has gathered over 200 precious artifacts,

501
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,800
has launched the special exhibition "The Grassland Silk Road Across Vast Distances",

502
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,820
Each artifact embodies the distinctive dual styles of the Western Regions and Central Plains,

503
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,520
vividly showcasing the cultural convergence and collision along the 10th-12th century Grassland Silk Road.

504
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,860
The museum offers not only static displays,

505
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,560
but also dynamic educational journeys through grassland studies,

506
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,920
allowing historical culture to take root and flourish in children's hearts.

507
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,720
Within the ancient city of Weishan, Yunnan,

508
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,600
children roam freely,

509
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
immersed in the Nanzhao Museum,

510
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,680
experiencing the ambiance of ancient market life,

511
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,540
exploring ancient architectural structures.

512
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,560
wood carving techniques,

513
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,020
and even try their hand at crafting intangible cultural heritage items.

514
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,340
